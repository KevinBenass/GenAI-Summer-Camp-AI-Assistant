I - How would you optimize the process if you had more time?

1. Optimize Router Prompt:

- Improve the Router Prompt's intent classification by fine-tuning the model or providing more training data. This can help it better distinguish between general inquiries and sign-up intentions.
- Handling Mixed Intents:
Implement logic to handle messages with mixed intents more effectively. If a message contains both an inquiry and a sign-up intention, prioritize the primary intent or guide the user to provide separate messages for clarity.

2. Optimize Question Prompt:

- Enhance the Question Prompt's ability to maintain context during a conversation. If a user asks follow-up questions, ensure the assistant understands the context and provides relevant responses.
- Make the responses generated by the Question Prompt more dynamic.

3. Optimize Application Prompt:
-Smarter Validation Checks:
Improve the Application Prompt's validation checks to provide more specific error messages. Instead of generic error messages, pinpoint the issue (e.g., "Invalid email format" or "Child's age must be between 8 and 15").

- Enhance the age criteria validation by accepting multiple age input formats and providing clear instructions on the expected format.

4. Optimize Overall User Experience:
- Seamless Transitions:
Ensure seamless transitions between prompts. If a user switches from making inquiries to expressing an intent to sign up, the assistant should smoothly transition without causing confusion.

- Personalization:
If feasible, incorporate personalization by remembering user details from previous interactions. This can create a more personalized and user-friendly experience.

- Feedback Mechanism:
Implement a feedback mechanism to collect user feedback on the responses and overall interaction. This data can be valuable for ongoing improvements.


II - How would you test the prompts' performance?
Router Prompt Testing:
- Test the Router Prompt in isolation to ensure it accurately classifies messages into general inquiries or sign-up intentions.
  Provide a variety of test messages to assess how well the prompt categorizes different intents. Include common inquiries, explicit sign-up intentions, and ambiguous messages.
- Edge Cases:
Test the prompt with edge cases, such as messages containing mixed intents or unclear language. Ensure the Router Prompt handles these situations appropriately.
- Mixed Intents Testing:
Send messages that contain both general inquiries and sign-up intentions to evaluate how the Router Prompt prioritizes and classifies multiple intents.

Question Prompt Testing:
- Provide a diverse set of general inquiry messages to check the robustness of the Question Prompt. Include questions about offerings, values, policies, etc.
- Test the Question Prompt's ability to maintain context and provide coherent responses when users ask follow-up questions or seek more details.
- Assess how the Question Prompt responds to queries that fall outside its designed scope. Ensure it gracefully handles unknown or unexpected questions.

Application Prompt Testing:
- Test the prompt with various scenarios to ensure it correctly validates the format of provided data, especially for email addresses and phone numbers.
- Evaluate how the Application Prompt enforces age criteria, checking that it accepts valid ages within the specified range and rejects invalid ones.

User Confirmation Process:
- Simulate the application process, ensuring that the prompt guides users through providing required details and confirms their submission before finalizing.
- Intentionally introduce errors, incomplete information, or incorrect formats to assess how well the Application Prompt handles such situations and provides clear guidance.
- Test the entire flow from the Router Prompt to the relevant prompt (Question or Application). Verify that the transitions are smooth and logical.


III - What edge cases do you think are not handled currently that you would add?

- If a user sends a message that is ambiguous or doesn't clearly fall into the categories of general inquiry or intent to sign up, the Router Prompt may struggle to categorize it accurately.
- Users might provide inaccurate or misleading information during the application process. For instance, entering a false child's age or incorrect contact details.
- Misspellings, or variations in user inputs might not be handled effectively, leading to misclassification or misinterpretation.
- If a user expresses both general inquiry and an intent to sign up in a single message, the Router Prompt may face challenges in accurately determining the primary intent.
- The Application Prompt may need additional checks to ensure that the provided email and phone number formats are valid. This includes verifying the correct number of digits in the phone number and a valid email format.
- There is currently no step for user confirmation or validation before finalizing the application.
